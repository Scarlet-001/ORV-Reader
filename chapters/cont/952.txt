<title>952 Episode 56 Myth (4)
It didn't take long to defeat Apollo.
He was a constellation who had reached 'mythical' status through a leap of faith, but he couldn't properly control his own rampaging stories
<!>[I—]
As the 'fears' arising from the Forest of Fear roared and charged, the black sun's corona shattered.
The pitch-black sun listlessly shed stories that weren't its own. Vidar's and Halla's stories let out resentful cries.
<&>「And then Yoo Joonghyuk's sword moved.」
The blade gliding gracefully sliced ​​through the dazzling light. For a moment, the sunlight was disrupted, and Apollo's face appeared through the split shadow of the black sun.
"I envy you all."
Apollo's voice, even the strength to utter his mantras, vanished. Watching Apollo, about to leave, I briefly considered another possibility for him.
"If it were another world—"
He was still a villain in the 40th round.
But I didn't bother telling him that story. Instead, I said,
"Yes, maybe it would have been different in another worldline."
I don't know if that comforted Apollo. However, in his final moments, he looked at me with a strange expression.
<&>「A god who hunted evil spirits and passed down prophecies and poetry for humans.」
Surely, such a worldline exists. However, in this one, his role was merely a medicine man.
Sugagak!
Apollo's legend crumbled under the simultaneous sword strikes of me and Yoo Joonghyuk.
<!>[The constellations of the Nebula, <Olympus>, remember the end of the 'Almighty Sun'.]
The constellations scattered, and the black heat that had threatened the forest subsided.
<!>[You have achieved an incredible feat!]
<!>[You have acquired a new story!]
As soon as I defeated Apollo, stories poured from the air.
I saw the roaring fears around me chomping down on a few fallen story fragments.
<!>[A vast amount of 'Loss' has been collected.]
<!>[The 'Loss' you have collected is recorded on the Final Wall.]
The 'Kim Dokja Fragment' Apollo held was also absorbed into me.
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', begins to devour!]
A faint heat bubbled near my heart.
Memories possessed by 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.
<&>「If we are the same Kim Dokja, why is there a distinction between the real and the fake?」
Perhaps this was what motivated Apollo.
Following this, the scenario interpretation reward message also appeared.
<!>[You have successfully interpreted the 'Impossible Agreement', a catastrophe-level fear!]
<!>[Interpretation suggestion: Trees and wine, a small shade for humanity under the sky.]
<!>[You are possessed by the power of fear.]
I felt the power of the 'Impossible Agreement', a catastrophe-level fear, seeping into me.
<!>[Sub-scenario—'Eradicating Fear' completed.]
<!>[You have earned 2,000,000 coins as a sub-scenario reward.]
The extraordinary reward details made feel amazed for a moment.
Even so, a sub-scenario rewarding millions of coins?
Considering the coin inflation caused by D-Coins, it's understandable, but...
<!>[You've acquired an exclusive trait as an additional reward for completing the sub-scenario.]
<!>[You've acquired the exclusive trait, 'Abyssal Understanding'.]
<!>[This trait greatly increases your affinity for stories!]
<!>[Your understanding of unfamiliar stories greatly increases!]
And now, I've even got an exclusive trait.
The trait I just received was exactly what I needed.
<!>[The main scenario content has been updated!]
<!>[You have acquired 500 additional tributes!]
The 500 tributes were a reward from the 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint' in this 'main scenario'.
Only those who acquired this tribute could escape through 'Ascension' in the 'Ascension Scenario'.
<!>[You currently have the 'most tributes' in the scenario area.]
However, the 'Impossible Agreement' was no longer a scourge of Murim. In other words, the incarnations no longer needed to acquire tribute to escape the 'Destruction Scenario'.
<!>[The 'Destruction Scenario' is currently in progress in that region.]
So, it would be natural for the 'Destruction Scenario' to be withdrawn soon...
But is the scenario still ongoing?
Amidst a sense of foreboding, Yoo Joonghyuk, having collected the scattered stories, quickly approached. He glanced around the spot where the deep sun had disappeared and said, "I'm going back now."
Where the sun had vanished, a swirling portal appeared. Perhaps if we ventured out there, we could escape the forest.
"I understand. You came in spirit form, didn't you?"
Yoo Joonghyuk nodded.
If 'Midday Tryst' wasn't far enough to reach, then Yoo Joonghyuk must have been somewhere separated from this area, both in time and space.
"Still, I see you received the message."
"You sent a story."
I sent a story about the 'Return War'. To be precise, I intertwined the story of the 'Return War' with Yoo Joonghyuk's [Fate].
<&>「The long-returned one will return to the forest ruled by the constellations.」
It was a gamble I could take, knowing that Yoo Joonghyuk would never abandon his master, no matter the circumstances.
"But this time, it's too late."
We were staring at the spot where Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had just moments ago. The figure that had been shedding pitch-black tears had vanished.
"Breaking the Sky Sword Saint's soul was never here."
"Was it a thought form that remained here?"
I nodded.
This 'fear' was originally a condensation of the stories Breaking the Sky Sword Saint left behind. Her soul had likely left the scenario area long ago.
Perhaps it was the price of her thoughts and true stories evolving into 'fear'.
<&>「I always just laughed.」
<!>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, activated in real time, was recording Yoo Joonghyuk. Even in such a vast shadow, Yoo Joonghyuk still couldn't rest.]
He knew I was reading him, yet he didn't show it.
"Have you acquired the forest?"
The only consolation I could offer him was to record this horrific story to the end.
"To a certain extent."
I felt the 'sake' of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint stirring within my shadow.
The fears that emerged from the forest included those on the scale of a natural disaster, including the 'Toothed Fin'.
The fears bared their white fangs at me.
Yoo Joonghyuk, staring at these fears, said,
"It couldn't have been easy."
Indeed, I nearly died fighting those creatures. Strictly speaking, I couldn't say I was handling them properly.
"I could talk for half a day if I wanted to."
I added, gazing at the distant passageway in the sky.
"I guess we'll have to wait until next time."
In the distance, I could see the portal entrance gradually narrowing. The situation was clear.
<&>「Someone is deliberately narrowing the passage.」
Yoo Joonghyuk, sensing the situation, hardened his expression and said, "It looks like they're trying to seal this place completely."
"I have a rough idea of ​​what they are."
Apollo, Vidar, Halla, and numerous other constellations had fallen victim to this 'World Tree'.
But a scenario of this scale wouldn't have been planned by just three narrative-grade people.
The constellations they'd plotted with would have made their move by now.
<&>「We have to get out now.」
I knew it instinctively. If I didn't escape now, they'd keep me trapped here until this round's ■■ arrived.
I looked around and saw Yoo Joonghyuk's soul body vanish. Having exhausted all the given probability, he was returning to his original location.
"Let's meet again."
Yoo Joonghyuk replied,
"Survive."
It was a brief greeting for a reunion after eight years. But it was enough. We knew each other were alive, and we knew we were struggling to see the end of this world.
<&>「All that remains is to confirm the stories we've built so far.」
I launched [Way of the Wind] with full force and ran. The surrounding scenery was pushed back.
I leaped into the portal. Time and space felt distorted, and in the distance, something blocked the narrowing entrance.
<&>「"Why do you like Jung Heewon?"」
Story fragments drifted through the air.
<&>「"That's..."」
I felt a deep symphony.
<&>「"Strange... Why can't I remember..."」
Cracks appeared between the faintly glowing incarnations. The arrows of the constellations penetrated through them.
I reached out and embraced her.
"Sein-ssi."
Kyung Sein, whom I held weakly, closed her eyes. I couldn't say thank you or sorry. At that moment, a single emotion dominated me.
<&>「I want to shatter all the constellations in the sky.」
Stories began to overflow from my body.
<!>[The constellation, 'First Heavenly Demon', can't take its eyes off you.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Maritime War God', can't take his eyes off you.]
<!>[The constellation, 'Bald Commander', can't take his eyes off you.]
The constellations I knew were watching me.
<!>[All the constellations of the nebula <Olympus> are watching you.]
<!>[All the constellations of the nebula <Asgard> are watching you.]
<!>[All the constellations of the nebula <Veda> are watching you.]
My enemies too.
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Fox Who Commands the Sky', records you.]
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Prince of Wolves', records you.]
<!>[The Recorder of Fear, 'Demon King of the Cinema', records you.]
Even recorders who devour this story. And—
<&>「And there was a single reader of this story.」
Looking at the sky, ablaze with bright starlight, I finally understood how this entire story began and how it must end.
<&>「The stage opened.」
The shadow of a giant pine tree spread across the floor.
<!>[The story, 'King of Fear' begins its storytelling.]
With a piercing sensation in my back, gigantic wings spread out as if to protect me.
<!>[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', begins its storytelling.]
The fears began to unfold. Fears of catastrophe, disaster, and natural disaster level, all reaching out toward the constellations. Among them, the one who took the lead in biting the incarnations was 'Toothed Fin'.
<#>【TeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeethTeeth】
With a roar, the Toothed Fin poured out of the guy’s mouth. The Toothed Fin swung a spear knife at the constellations.
<&>「When the stories that have passed away invade the sky of the constellations once again.」
With the prediction of the recorders, the Outer Gods who returned to the scenario were crying.
"The owner of fears will return to the <Star Stream>."
As I tamed the Outer Gods from the Fear Realm, I made them one promise.
<&>「"I have nothing to give you. I cannot promise to return you to the scenario, nor can I promise to protect you from the constellations or destruction. But all I can do is—"」
Beings abandoned by the scenario and turned into 'fears'’
I had only one promise to make to them.
<&>「"I will show you the ■■ of this world, too."」
Just a small space. An ancient fear was rising above that space.
The World Tree of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint grew into a pitch-black shadow, piercing the starry sky.
<!>[The constellation, 'Ruler of the Southern Sea Dragon Palace', cannot hide his sympathy.]
The constellations pierced by the branches of the World Tree writhe, spewing out stories.
<&>「The world born from the blood of the annihilators will despise the old heavens.」
Several constellations, sensing the strange turn of events, began to retreat into the darkness.
<!>[Some constellations are preparing an emergency scenario exit!]
The ruler of the South Sea Dragon Palace, belatedly realizing the situation, pointed at me and spoke.
<@>[Don't panic, everyone! If we catch him, it'll all be over. He's just a single narrative-grade incarnation. He...!]
The constellations that had been rushing towards me were devoured by the fears that erupted around me.
Glancing at the fading starlight, the South Sea Dragon King's mantra subsided.
<@>[He...!]
A massive spark ignited throughout my body. I desperately used my unique traits and stories to quell the aftershock. With a calm expression, I walked towards the constellations.
It was then that I felt a strange sense of urgency.
<&>「I felt a sense of being watched from a gigantic round table.」
Simultaneously, a change occurred within me.
<!>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', has completed its predation.]
<!>[Your 'Kim Dokja Fragment' count has exceeded the critical threshold.]
The constellations screamed in the sky stained with fear. The constellations that once enjoyed stories were no longer there.
<&>「And thus, the story that the constellations fear was born.」
I approached the South Sea Dragon King.
The South Sea Dragon King, whose entire body had been bitten by the Outer Gods, pointed at me, spitting out stories.
<@>[How.]
The creature staggered back, overcome by the poison, and began to shout.
<@>[How! A constellation, a being not even human, by a being that didn't even make it to the final scenario, how on earth could…!]
The South Sea Dragon King, who had been speaking up to that point, fell silent.
My image was reflected in the constellation's eyes. The constellation's emotions were transmitted in real time through its swaying eyes.
Shock, grief, and awe.
<@>[Could it be…]
The blade of 'Unbreakable Faith' slashed at the creature's neck.
<&>「The constellations must see this.」
I raised my head, suppressing the endless stream of stories swirling within me.
<&>「They must know that this story has finally reached this point.」
Only when I reached this high sky did it begin to sink in.
Even though so many constellations had fallen, the sky was still studded with countless constellations.
<!>[All the dokkaebis of the 'Management Bureau' exceptionally acknowledge your 'rank'.]
But now, only a few twinkle above me.
<!>[The <Star Stream> announces your 'rank'.]
I slowly turned around and saw the fears staring up at me. Forgotten things, barely able to record their own sanctity in the fleeting moments, howled and prostrated themselves before me.
<!>[Your rank is 'mythical'.]
With a feeling like a hazy veil was being lifted, the message came.
<!>[You have earned the right to witness the world's ■■.]
