<title>612 Episode 12 □□ (3)
In a face-to-face confrontation with Han Sooyoung, there was no chance of winning. The level of proficiency in scenarios, the amount of stories accumulated and the experience as a human being were all different.
<&>「But the sentences lingering at my fingertips were telling me otherwise.」
That here, it would be different. The disadvantage remained the same, but here, it was worth a try.
As I focuses my mind, I felt the pulse of the letters floating around me.
The sentences written by Han Sooyoung and rewritten by me.
The moment I reached out my hand into the air, I felt the story wrap itself around my fingertips.
<&>「Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye, smiling brightly, was aiming her Twin Dragon Sword at me.」
The instant I grasped the sentence, a sword appeared in my hand along with a bright light.
It is the holy relic of the Maritime War God.
Lee Jihye's exclusive weapon, Twin Dragon Sword.
<&>「"Exterminate them, Twin Dragon Sword"」
Lee Jihye of the 1,863rd turn finally reached the edge of the scenarios after going through a hellish scenario and going through training in Murim.
<&>「She who survived up to the 95th scenario is, without a doubt, one of the top 100 strongest in 'Ways of Survival'.」
The stories Lee Jihye had accumulated were now wriggling in my mind.
"Lee Jihye."
Han Sooyoung, who was watching the sentence in my hand from afar, said nonchalantly.
"Okay, come on"
I took a step forward without hesitation.
Bluffing against Han Sooyoung does not work.
I immediately activated Lee Jihye's strongest skill from the 1,863rd turn.
<&>「Instant Kill.」
I became a flash of lightning and rushed toward Han Sooyoung.
Quadddeuk!
A violent load slammed on her right arm.
The pitch-black [Black Flames] soared from Han Sooyoung's left hand, striking back against the sword strike of [Instant Kill].
As if she were the real 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', the entire floor burned black from the [Black Flame] she unleashed.
Even though a collision of power of this magnitude occurred in the only beginning of the scenarios, a probability storm was not felt.
"I see what kind of world it is."
As if she had the same thoughts as me, Han Sooyoung smiled.
"Probability, huh?. Doesn't matter here, right?"
In the next moment, the brilliance of pure white flames shone from Han Sooyoung's right hand.
<&>「A sword shimmering with white flames appeared in her hand.」
I glared at the sentences wrapped around the white-flamed sword.
<&>「Before her sword, all the surrounding flames extinguished in homage.」
Cold sweat ran down my back.
It was because I realized what sentence Han Sooyoung was trying to call.
<&>「Infernal flames.」
<&>「Hellfire.」
I hurriedly came up with a new sentence, leaving Yoo Joonghyuk and Jung Heewon behind.
<&>「"Lee Hyunsung doesn’t need a sword. Because that guy is a sword."」
The most important thing in this world was imagination.
The power of a sentence is determined by how high, sharp, and elaborate the intensity of the imagination constituting the sentence is.
<&>「True steel will be born from tens of thousands of hardenings.」
<!>[Steel Sword, the stigma of Emperor of Steelsword Lee Hyunsung, flooded around me and covered the entire area.]
However, with my inexperienced imagination, I cannot fully protect Jung Heewon and Yoo Joonghyuk.
In the end, the pouring flame hit Yoo Joonghyuk, who was frozen. The flames of [Hellfire] melted the steel exterior, and I screamed as I absorbed the heat.
Han Sooyoung's [Hellfire] was much stronger and more severe than the [Steel Sword] I imagined.
When the heat subsided a bit, I caught my breath and looked back at Yoo Joonghyuk, who was covered in flames.
Yoo Joonghyuk was not hurt at all.
The flames of [Hellfire] passed by Yoo Joonghyuk in reality and burned only the armor I created.
As if my reaction was funny, Han Sooyoung said.
"You don't seem to understand the rules of this world."
An understanding came to my mind belatedly.
This is the snowfield, the space between the lines of the story.
All sentences present here are 'words not yet recorded'.
So until the record is decided, our fight has no effect outside the snowfield.
After catching my breath, Han Sooyoung asked me.
"Why are you protecting that guy? You don't even know him properly."
"This Yoo Joonghyuk..."
Why do I protect this Yoo Joonghyuk?
"...is different from the one you wrote."
Han Sooyoung wrote about Yoo Joonghyuk in the 41st turn and his heartlessness.
However, the Yoo Joonghyuk of the 41st turn I saw was a little different from Han Sooyoung's description.
"Aren’t you also vaguely aware of it? I don't know why, but this Yoo Joonghyuk is not a villain. He is not the kind of man who would abandon his comrades."
"I already wrote that, and that's what he will do. Stopping him here will avoid unnecessary sacrifices."
"Are you serious?"
Han Sooyoung answered with a short silence.
"Yes."
"I know what kind of person you are."
There comes a moment in everyone's life when you have to defend yourself by saying, "I'm not a bad person."
That's pretty exhausting.
As the history of one's life grows longer, it becomes difficult to make excuses for everything that's happened so far, and you think, what's the point anyway?
I wonder if Han Sooyoung is thinking like that?
"It doesn't matter who I am. It matters what kind of story I write."
I understood Han Sooyoung.
Han Sooyoung is a writer who has thoroughly written stories for only one person.
If she had treated all of her characters as real people, she wouldn't have been able to get to this point.
"If you want to convince me, write a sentence worthy of it."
I remembered the combat power rankings ranked by readers.
At least those who are far enough to subdue the present Han Sooyoung.
The Oldest Dream
Indescribable Distance .
The Apocalypse Dragon.
However, it was difficult to precisely specify their strength.
I imagined images and came up with sentences, but the sentences were rarely reproduced.
The same was true for other deities from different worlds, or even for 'Great Sage, Heaven's Equal', the strongest among the myth-grade constellations.
At that moment, I met eyes with Yoo Joonghyuk, who was staring blankly into space.
Eyes filled with the black night sky.
I grabbed the sentence that came to me almost reflexively.
<&>「Ways of Survival: The most righteous and loneliest Constellation of all.」
I could hear the black night on my back.
"The darkness that had been silent for a long time was waking up."
How about a sentence about him?
The stepfather of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.
If I borrowed the power of one of Olympus' strongest three gods...
<&>「One of the three gods of <Olympus>, 'Father of the Rich Night'.」
I felt a pitch-black darkness envelop my whole body, and my right hand began to tremble madly.
Even in the 'Snowfield', where everything was possible, it was a difficult existence to realize with my imagination.
The scythe of Hades descended in my right hand, black as if it had been carved out of the abyss.
Almost at the same time, Han Sooyoung's left hand also wrote a sentence.
<&>「Where his spear touches, there shall be the sea's boundary.」
I felt my ankles get damp, and the snowy floor was filled with waves in an instant.
<!>['Sea God' Poseidon.]
The black night and the vast sea collided.
As if the horizon were a boundary, my vision felt torn apart, and the world spun several times over.
When I woke up, I was on my knees on the floor gasping for breath.
"Let’s just end it here. You can’t beat me."
Han Sooyoung was looking down at me.
"If you leave now, I'll let you go. You don't seem to have the qualifications anyway."
Qualifications?
"Can you use [Avatar]?"
Along with Han Sooyoung's words, countless dolls appeared by her side.
Lee Jihye.
Yoo Sangah.
Lee Hyunsung.
Lee Gilyoung.
Jung Heewon.
Shin Yoosung.
Gong Pildu.
I stared blankly at those faces. Even knowing that all of those dolls were Han Sooyoung's [Avatar]-fakes, I felt like I was going against the whole <Kim Dokja’s Company>.
“If you had obtained the 'Writer' attribute, you should be able to use it. You don't seem to have it."
I didn't want to admit it.
So, over and over again, I shouted inwardly.
<&>「Avatar.」
However, [Avatar] did not activate.
Why can't I use [Avatar]?
In this world where everything is possible, why isn't that sentence mine?
"It means you're not a proper 'writer'."
I screamed and ran towards Han Sooyoung.
The bullet shot by Gong Pildu pierced my shoulder with a sound of fissit.
Spinning twice in midair, I grasped new sentences in my hands.
<&>「Shooting arrows like rain and shooting various gun barrels, the chaos was like a thunderstorm.」
<&>「"This is why I curse this land, but I can’t leave."」
<&>「Therefore, Taejo is a dot, so the smallest is the greatest.」
Maritime War God.
Goryeo's First Sword.
Kyrgios.
Maritime War God and Lee Jihye's Ghost Fleet exchanged artillery fire at the same time. A hazy sea fog obstructed the view from the continuous shelling.
I approached Han Sooyoung in an instant with Kyrgios's [Transcendence].
The moment Han Sooyoung's shadow swayed through the fog, Cheok Jungyeong's [Three Sword Style] was activated from my right hand.
<&>「This is a sword made to deal with the sea.」
However, before it could be activated, something grabbed my ankle. It was Yoo Sangah's [Arachne's Web].
Subsequently, Lee Hyunsung’s [Mountain Breaker] slapped my shoulder, and Shin Yoosung's 'Chimera Dragon' breathed at me.
I threw myself into the sea and rolled over several times, vomiting blood.
Is this blood really my blood? Or was even this blood just letters in the story?
I heard Han Sooyoung's voice.
"Stop it. It's amazing that you, who aren't even a writer, came this far."
I looked up at her, wiping my mouth with my sleeve.
There was still a way.
A fairly effective way to persuade her, too.
My hand drifted toward my pocket, then stopped. Using it felt somehow cowardly.
I have my own way.
If I am also a writer, I have to compete with only my own sentences.
"No matter what method you use, it is useless. It's obvious what sentences you're going to write."
Han Sooyoung's eyes were shining brightly.
<&>「Nothing new under the sun. Everything that will be written in the future is a transformation of what has already been written.」
Han Sooyoung's main stigma was finally showing up.
<&>「Predictive Plagiarism.」
There was nothing in this world that Han Sooyoung did not know. Because she actually went through all these sentences, and she wrote them down.
"This world doesn't need a new sentence."
Watching Han Sooyoung approaching step by step, I thought of Kim Dokja.
If I could become that guy, wouldn't I be able to break this situation?
However, the sentence about Kim Dokja never came to mind. If you think about it, even if it worked, it would have been difficult to change the situation because Kim Dokja was not particularly good at fighting.
Is there really no way left for me?
In this world, isn’t there a sentence that Han Sooyoung doesn’t know about?
"Take a rest."
The moment Han Sooyoung's left hand pointed at me once again, and the gun barrels of Lee Jihye and Gong Pildu moved toward me.
There is. A sentence she doesn't know.
Like a thunderbolt, a memory was planted in my head.
It took time to put the plan into action.
I caught my breath and opened my mouth.
"… Didn't Kim Dokja come back?"
Han Sooyoung's expression hardened.
Neither of us spoke, but I could tell we were both thinking the same sentence.
<&>「The ending of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』.」
The moment when Kim Dokja's story came back, the system was revived, and Han Sooyoung laughed openly at the hospital’s room door.
In the meantime, I believed that Kim Dokja would return.
It's an open ending, but every sentence in the climax pointed to Kim Dokja's return.
The return of Kim Dokja was in the reader's imagination, out of reach of the author's sentences.
That's why the scene is not described.
That's why I couldn't understand why Han Sooyoung was here right now.
If Kim Dokja had returned safely, there would be no way Han Sooyoung would be here right now.
"That..."
Han Sooyoung's lips, which were slowly open, spat out strange words.
"It hasn't been decided yet."
Not decided?
I couldn't understand Han Sooyoung's words.
But at least one goal was achieved.
I bought enough time with this.
"He's—"
With the sound of Tsutsutsutsutsu, Han Sooyoung's whole body was once again engulfed in sparks. And that moment.
<&>「A dark red coat amidst in the ruins.」
I grabbed the hidden sentence.
<&>「Black wings protruding through the coat.」
A sentence that even Han Sooyoung, who wrote this whole world, does not know.
This was a story that did not appear in the Ways of Survival she wrote.
<&>「'The One Who Deceived the Stars', and the 'Evil Sophist'.」
I activated [Incite], recalling the stories of the 40th turn I had seen.
<&>「I am Cheon Inho of the 40th turn.」
Han Sooyoung looked at me with her eyes wide open.
Formidable power welled up in my whole body.
The villain who threatened Yoo Joonghyuk in the 40th turn and drove the stars to ruin.
The unprecedented Ten Evils who fought the final battle with the main character while holding Yoo Joonghyuk's poisonous weapon: Black Heavenly Demon Sword.
Han Sooyoung sent me a signal as if she felt something out of the ordinary.
Gong Pildu's turret embraced fire, and Lee Jihye's [Ghost Fleet] opened fire. Yoo Sangah's threads twisted the space, and Lee Hyunsung's [Steel Sword] exploded at me.
<&>「[Story 'When All Stars Close Their Eyes' begins its storytelling.]」
All the stars closed their eyes.
<&>「The main theme is pitch-black darkness. No starlight could illuminate Cheon Inho. No miracle, no light.」
Embarrassed, Han Sooyoung hurriedly looked around.
<&>「It was as if Han Soo-young was alone.」
The moment Han Sooyoung, embarrassed, raised her left hand wildly.
<&>「The  Black Heavenly Demon Sword slashed her back.」
With an intense spark, she felt the tip of her sword and came to her senses. The sword made of sentences shattered, and I rolled across the floor in a mess.
It was shallow.
However, there was a sense that it was clearly cut.
When I hurriedly got up from the floor, Han Sooyoung was looking at me with her blank eyes.
"You. What-"
A cracking sound was heard somewhere.
<!>[Giant Story 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' shakes uneasily.]
There were fine scratches on the surface of the sentences that protected her.
<&>「"Sooyoung-ssi! Over there!"」
It was a sentence I knew.
<&>「I could see Lee Seolhwa’s hospital in the distance. The leisurely flowing stories did not bring them down. Stories were pouring in from the wards they knew.」
The scene drawn by the sentence was vivid in front of my eyes.
The people of <Kim Dokja’s Company> were rushing to the hospital.
Their story of waking up again.
The last story of <Kim Dokja’s Company>, which has been struggling to revive just one reader for such a long time.
<&>「The door creaks open. Faint sunlight was coming in through the wide open window.」
<&>「The manuscripts she was editing all night were blown away by the wind and scattered dazzlingly.」
<&>「The story she hadn't finished was there.」
A story written by Han Sooyoung, written down by me, and read by readers.
<&>「A sentence that she definitely wanted to write someday, even if not now. Thinking of that sentence, Han Sooyoung laughed like an idiot.」
It was the 'final scene' of the 『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』 we know.
<&>「This is a story for only one reader.」
"Wait. Stop! Stop!"
With the image of Han Sooyoung stretching out her hand while shouting. A bright light flowed from the snowflake.
And the next moment.
<&>「Lee Hakhyun finally reached the end.」
