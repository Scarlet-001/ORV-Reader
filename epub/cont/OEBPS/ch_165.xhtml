<hr/>
<p>Bullets flew from somewhere and rained down on his head. The cargo's surprise commission accomplishments evacuated the incarnation.</p>
<p>"What kind of guy—!"</p>
<p>At the same time, shells more than twice the amount of charge poured out. It was not ordinary bullets.</p>
<p>Each magical bullet was filled with concentrated magical energy.</p>
<p>As several incarnations fell after being attacked, the enraged Constellations looked in the direction where the fire started.</p>
<p>"Those scum-like incarnations—"</p>
<p>The incarnations dressed as refugees continued shooting.</p>
<p>"Keep shooting."</p>
<p>There was a man standing in the center of the refugees.</p>
<p>Jacob Martinez.</p>
<p>Las Vegas’s 'King of the North'.</p>
<p>The historical-grade Constellations, running at remarkable speed, quickly broke through the ranks of refugees and rushed at Martinez.</p>
<p>The moment Martinez opened his eyes, the historical-grade Constellations in each direction cut off Martin so ez's arms and torso.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! You idiot!"</p>
<p>The severed limbs along with the blood flowed through the air.</p>
<p>[The character 'Jacob Martinez' activates 'Cutting Magic Lv.7'!]</p>
<p>Martinez, who quickly put the cut off limbs back together, looked toward the back and spoke.</p>
<p>"We can’t take too long. The opponent is &lt;Olympus&gt;."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"Go. With this, the North has paid its debt."</p>
<p>The woman nodded her head and hugged the fallen Demon King of Salvation. Her body trembled as he entered the process of extinction.</p>
<p>"Don’t move."</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation looked up at the woman. An off-white color that shines brightly even on the battlefield.</p>
<p>It wasn't the face he remembered.</p>
<p>"I thought it was Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"I am her incarnation."</p>
<p>The incarnation of Yoo Sangah. Maybe that's why the atmosphere strangely resembles Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p>"It’s dangerous out here. If you’re here to save the Youngest, you’re in the wrong place. The Youngest is over there—"</p>
<p>"They’re still negotiating with the 'Recycling Center'."</p>
<p>Are the negotiations still not over?</p>
<p>Then the situation was not good.</p>
<p>A situation where &lt;Olympus&gt; resurrected Ares by burning a giant tale. If he doesn’t send the Youngest up quickly—</p>
<p>"Is that all you have to say?"</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu said as she ran while holding the Demon King of Salvation in her arms.</p>
<p>"There’s something I need to say first."</p>
<p>An incarnation that resembles Yoo Sangah not only in her mood but also in her tone of voice.</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu continued her words with a light sigh.</p>
<p>"I was asked to keep an eye on you because you might still do something like this."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"She wanted to use the Golden Headband, but she also asked me to tell you that it’s a pity that she couldn’t do that."</p>
<p>Golden Headband.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation opened his mouth without realizing it.</p>
<p>"I am not the Kim Dokja that Yoo Sangah is looking for."</p>
<p>As he said those words, the Demon King of Salvation thought of the Third child. The Third had the main memory related to the 'Headband'.</p>
<p>"As if that person isn’t Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>In the rapidly rushing scenery, the Demon King of Salvation felt his stories dispersing.</p>
<p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' continues with a stutter.]</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu's hand wrapped around him and held on to the scattered stories.</p>
<p>"You are the Kim Dokja she is looking for."</p>
<p>It was a very warm hand.</p>
<p>"I’ve read more stories about you than anyone else, so I guarantee you."</p>
<p>Is it because the woman telling that story really looked like Yoo Sangah?</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"How is Yoo Sangah?"</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"Tell her I’m sorry."</p>
<p>"Please tell her directly."</p>
<p>"You say you are the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>"You heard I’m not Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>"For now, let’s assume you’re Yoo Sangah. So—"</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation knew.</p>
<p>Yoo Sangah cannot come here.</p>
<p>He doesn't know if it's because of the 'scale of probability' or the restrictions of the 'Void Curtain', but at least she won't be able to come until he dies.</p>
<p>Perhaps his words will not be conveyed properly to Yoo Sangah.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>But at least it will remain as a story.</p>
<p>And one day, Yoo Sangah will read his story left on this wall.</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation was satisfied with that.</p>
<p>"Really, thank you."</p>
<p>His scenario is now over.</p>
<p>Now the protagonist and characters of this story have changed.</p>
<p>"I don’t know what you’re thankful for."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the story continues.</p>
<p>"I’m going to ask, so make sure you’re alive until then."</p>
<p>Is it because there is still a story left unfinished?</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation slowly blinked his eyes and asked.</p>
<p>"Is that what Yoo Sangah just said?"</p>
<p>"That’s just what I said?"</p>
<p>"You are just the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>"I just decided to be Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu said, kicking the ground with all her might and running.</p>
<p>"I don’t know, but Yoo Sangah would definitely have said that."</p>
<p>The explosion sound coming from behind was gradually fading away.</p>
<p>The northern king's troops were annihilated.</p>
<p>"I heard about you from my Youngest."</p>
<p>Editor Ji Eunyu.</p>
<p>In his Youngest's memory, she was quite an important figure.</p>
<p>She was the first to read and edit the stories the Youngest wrote. Perhaps, without her, his 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' written by his Youngest would not have been possible.</p>
<p>「"Writer, look. Kim Dokja’s lines here are a bit strange."」</p>
<p>"I think this line suits him."</p>
<p>"No! Look, he wasn’t a character who spoke like this before—"</p>
<p>"Isn’t that the character’s three-dimensionality?"</p>
<p>"This is not three-dimensional, it’s a kabung."」</p>
<p>A thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p>If he and Yoo Sangah had been reincarnated in a different world, wouldn't they have been like that?</p>
<p>「Doesn’t Kim Dokja want to be someone else sometimes?」</p>
<p>A world without scenarios and Constellations. A world where all these tragedies are just imagination in the lines of text.</p>
<p>The Youngest came from that world.</p>
<p>"You stayed here to save the Youngest?"</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu did not answer.</p>
<p>"You’re like the Youngest Yoo Sangah."</p>
<p>"I’m not Yoo Sangah. Stop talking. The story will be scattered."</p>
<p>"I’m going to die anyway. There’s less than a minute left."</p>
<p>Ji Eunyu’s steps stopped.</p>
<p>The historical-grade Constellations hidden in the front line appeared one by one. Additional historical-grade Constellations dispatched from &lt;Olympus&gt; appeared accompanied by their incarnations.</p>
<p>"Turn off [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] and run away! That’s it."</p>
<p>"No. I’ve put restrictions on it."</p>
<p>It is different from the general [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation risked his own life to kill the incarnations of historical-grade and kill the incarnation of Ares, a Narrative-grade Constellation.</p>
<p>"This [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] cannot be canceled on its own."</p>
<p>In other words, when this incarnation body disappears, he also disappears.</p>
<p>"What on earth were you thinking? You’re the one they’re after."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"Then why—"</p>
<p>Why did he do such an unreasonable thing?</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation doesn't know much either.</p>
<p>He may have believed that his stage was not over yet.</p>
<p>He may have wanted to recreate the days when he was hunting down Constellations as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>When he saw the story of the Youngest fighting desperately alone, his blood boiled without him knowing, and he may have wanted to prove that he, too, was a 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>The 'Thoughts' borrowed from the Youngest hummed and cried.</p>
<p>"The Demon King of Salvation I know never dies."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"You know that he is a person who survives no matter what he does, right?"</p>
<p>Historical-grade Constellations approached from all directions.</p>
<p>There was no place to run now.</p>
<p>There was no way for them to escape unless the 'Star Ladder' came down.</p>
<p>But what star would dare to lower the 'Star Ladder' against the 'Giant Nebula'?</p>
<p>"So please save him."</p>
<p>As Ji Eunyu said those words, her gaze rested on Cheon Inho in the distance for a moment.</p>
<p>"Please, save Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation listened to those words blankly. Perhaps he came all the way here because he wanted to hear those words.</p>
<p>[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to continue its storytelling.]</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation, who stumbled out of Ji Eunyu's arms, spoke.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Beyond the incarnations of historical-grade Constellations that surrounded them, a man with a fearsome appearance was walking.</p>
<p>"Demon—King—of—Salvation"</p>
<p>It was the resurrected incarnation of Ares.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsu!</p>
<p>Ares walked forward, enduring aftereffects that exceeded the probability limit.</p>
<p>Even if all his remaining stories were exploded, it was impossible to defeat him.</p>
<p>Thunder struck once again across the night sky. The Demon King of Salvation thought of Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk or Kim Dokja Company will not be able to come. Because the Giant Nebulae will be blocking them by sacrificing their giant stories.</p>
<p>Not only them, but no one else in this world can intervene in this scenario where the Giant Nebulae run rampant.</p>
<p>「Except for only one place.」</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation raised his head.</p>
<p>"Are you there?"</p>
<p>They are the group that controls this 'world' itself.</p>
<p>Those who control the scenario in the torrent of the &lt;Star Stream&gt; and guide the world to the ■■ of everything.</p>
<p>"Bihyung."</p>
<p>Sparks struck in the air at the call of the Demon King of Salvation. And,</p>
<p>—Are you serious?</p>
<p>Bihyung, a Dokkaebi belonging to the 'Management Bureau' responded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation knew. Bihyung is probably not the only one listening to him now.</p>
<p>The Great Dokkaebis of this world line— even perhaps the Dokkaebi King beyond—are also listening to his story.</p>
<p>And what he's going to say, he's already guessing.</p>
<p>—The price will be very high.</p>
<p>He knows. Perhaps it would be more cruel than death.</p>
<p>"It does not matter."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he has to meet his Youngest again.</p>
<p>When they meet, he has to tell him what he hasn't told him yet.</p>
<p>What kind of person is the 'real Kim Dokja'?</p>
<p>Where is Han Sooyoung, whom he was searching for?</p>
<p>How can readers from other world lines be sent back?</p>
<p>Who is the guy who killed us?</p>
<p>And—</p>
<p>「Why does this 'world' exist?」</p>
<p>The Constellations noticed something unusual and rushed towards this direction.</p>
<p>"That bastard! Stop him—!"</p>
<p>Looking at them, the Demon King of Salvation grinned.</p>
<p>「You will get nothing.」</p>
<p>The Demon King of Salvation declared.</p>
<p>"I will dedicate myself to the &lt;Star Stream&gt;."</p>
<p>Then the world responded to his words.</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; accepts your offer.]</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is consecrated to the 'Star Stream'.]</p>
<p>"Stop! You bastard!"</p>
<p>The fact that the Constellation sealed itself in the 'Star Stream' was tantamount to voluntarily becoming the subject of a scenario.</p>
<p>[The mayor of 'Jeonsang City' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p>
<p>[The host of 'Ragnarok' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p>
<p>[The 'Fallen ruins' owner wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p>
<p>[The creator of the 'Holy Demon War' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The director of the 'Recycling Center' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]</p>
<p>He didn't know how he would be used in which scenario. But now he had offered himself and was entitled to ask for it in return.</p>
<p>"I accept the granting authority of the 'Star Ladder'."</p>
<p>[The 'Management Bureau' approves your payment.]</p>
<p>Ares arrived right in front of the Demon King of Salvation and swung his spear.</p>
<p>In a split second, a dazzling beam of light appeared and the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation' disappeared.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>At the same time, a bright ladder began to come down from thin air.</p>
<p>「Star Ladder.」</p>
<p>An opportunity to ascend to heaven given to several incarnations in exchange for the Constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'.</p>
<p>Anna Croft and Selena Kim climbed the ladder to help Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk, who had fallen, and Ji Eunyu also held onto the ladder with Martinez.</p>
<p>The ladder carrying all the scheduled incarnations began to ascend to the sky.</p>
<p>Coo coo coo coo!</p>
<p>Ares was furious and went berserk.</p>
<p>"I can’t admit it!"</p>
<p>Ares's angry body stretched out his hand toward the Star Ladder.</p>
<p>"Stop it! Stop his incarnation from using the Star Ladder! Just make him drop it somehow!"</p>
<p>Historical-grade Constellations, including the Gatekeeper of Thebes, belatedly attacked the ladder.</p>
<p>However, a translucent curtain created sparks and blocked their intervention.</p>
<p>"How dare you—"</p>
<p>At that moment, Ares felt like the scales of the scenario were balanced.</p>
<p>It was impossible.</p>
<p>If there is a being who can achieve equilibrium with a Narrative-grade Constellation—</p>
<p>[Stop, Ares.]</p>
<p>All the Constellations, including Ares, stopped along with their incarnations at the mantra filled with tremendous power.</p>
<p>Ares lifted his head and looked up at the sky in disbelief.</p>
<p>At the end of the Star Ladder leading to the 'Recycling Center' were beings with pure white wings spread out.</p>
<p>Unlike &lt;Olympus&gt; and &lt;Asgard&gt;, which participated in the scenario, these stars were the only ones among the three Giant Nebulae that remained silent.</p>
<p>"Eden!"</p>
<p>[The Constellation 'Lilies Blooming on Water Ice' reveals themselves!]</p>
<p>A line of Constellations was blocking the road leading to the Recycling Center.</p>
<p>[The scenario is over. Without further compromising probability, go back to your own context.]</p>
<p>"How dare you, how dare you—"</p>
<p>Ares couldn't understand. Why is &lt;Eden&gt; involved in this situation?</p>
<p>Especially at this timing.</p>
<p>Ares bit his lip and revealed his fierceness to the being standing beyond the Archangels.</p>
<p>"Center Director! I know you’re hiding there!"</p>
<p>There is no need to fight &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>After all, the 'Star Ladder' is not under the jurisdiction of &lt;Eden&gt;.</p>
<p>"Cancel the Star Ladder! The 'Demon King of Salvation' is ours!"</p>
<p>[No. Now he belongs to the '&lt;Star Stream&gt;'.]</p>
<p>With a hollow laugh, the Center Director's voice was heard from the Archangel's shadow.</p>
<p>[&lt;Olympus&gt;. Have you forgotten the Nebula Agreement? You cannot interfere with the 'Recycling Center' scenario.]</p>
<p>"Asgard has declared [Fate]. Three [Fate] messages have been sent to him! He cannot avoid them! He—"</p>
<p>[The Fate that came down to him was to 'die in a loved story'.]</p>
<p>When all the incarnations completed their ascension, the 'Star Ladder' began to disperse. The portal to the Recycling Center was closing little by little.</p>
<p>The Center Director, with a strange smile, left his last words while looking at the ruined Washington Dome.</p>
<p>[I guess that story isn't here.]</p>
<p>"Wait! Wait! You guys—"</p>
<p>['Star Ladder' has disappeared.]</p>
<p>[All scenarios in the 'Washington Dome' area end.]</p>
<p>[The scales of the scenario are tipped.]</p>
<p>[The balance of probability is lost.]</p>
<p>Ares and the historical-grade Constellations that were left behind hurriedly looked at each other.</p>
<p>Unusual sparks were raging throughout Washington.</p>
<p>"Everyone withdraw—"</p>
<p>[A potential storm begins to blow!]</p>
<p>The aftermath that followed erased everything in Washington.</p>
