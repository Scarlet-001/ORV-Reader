<img style="display:block;margin:auto" alt="icon" src="stigma.png"/><h2 style="text-align:center;">955 Episode 56 Myth (7)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>The exact nature of the 'Hunchback King' is not detailed in either the 'Way of Survival' or 'ORV'.</p>
<p>However, several clues about him clearly exist.</p>
<p>「A constellation that enjoys changing genders.」</p>
<p>The first time the creature appeared in the main story was when Shin Yoosoung of the 41st round emerged.</p>
<p>More precisely, when Kim Dokja possessed Shin Yoosoung of the 41st round.</p>
<p>But its true identity was not simply that of a 'constellation with a peculiar taste'.</p>
<p>「Anna Croft's Contract Holder.」</p>
<p>The entity that effectively brought 'Prophet Anna Croft' into being.</p>
<p>This very creature was the sponsor behind her receiving the 'Eyes of the Great Demon' and securing the backing of &lt;Asgard&gt;.</p>
<p>「The one who alters his own existence.」</p>
<p>That was one of his epithets.</p>
<p>&lt;Asgard&gt;'s Star - The God of Mischief, 'Loki'.</p>
<p>But his true identity wasn't Loki. He was one who had wandered the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, endlessly shifting his existence, a powerhouse formidable enough to even check that 'Dokkaebi King'.</p>
<p>「[You've never heard this story, have you? It's not even preserved as stories now. Only the 'Apocalypse Dragon', driven mad by the repeated cycles of time, might barely remember it.]」</p>
<p>An existence as ancient as the primordial calamity, the 'Apocalypse Dragon'.</p>
<p>"You won't answer?"</p>
<p>I looked at the 'Balance of Judgment' and spoke again.</p>
<p>「I have no certainty that the being beyond this is the 'Hunchback King'.」</p>
<p>Nevertheless, several pieces of circumstantial evidence pointed to him.</p>
<p>「An entity capable of interfering with the scenario.」</p>
<p>「An entity that is not merely a constellation.」</p>
<p>「An entity that can wield the ancient 'fear' of another world and enjoys 'deals'.」</p>
<p>Considering these various conditions, several figures came to mind. But when imagining an entity capable of devising a treacherous device like the 'Settlement Scale', the category narrowed drastically.</p>
<p>"Seems you're not curious about what lies beyond the Final Wall?"</p>
<p>No sooner had my words fallen than a sinister aura stirred beyond the 'Settlement Scale'.</p>
<p>"That's why you're gathering the 'Kim Dokja Fragments'. isn't it? To peek beyond the wall. Constantly shifting your identity to interfere with the scenario, even antagonizing the Management Bureau—"</p>
<p>A thick, bloody stench began permeating the air. From within the scales came a sound like flesh being crushed. Realizing something was terribly wrong, Jung Heewon grabbed my sleeve.</p>
<p>"Dokja-ssi."</p>
<p>The moment I inhaled to respond, the world spun upside down. It felt like every piece of common sense I knew was being smashed into the ground. I was connected to something.</p>
<p>[The owner of the 'Settlement Scale' is watching you.]</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I'd had a similar experience when I'd caught a strand of hair in the scales before.</p>
<p>If my memory served me right, back then I'd definitely made brief contact with the 'Oldest Liberator'.</p>
<p>The 'Oldest Liberator' was the final form of Jecheon Daeseong, a constellation that didn't exist in this worldline.</p>
<p>In other words, this 'scale' was also connected to the outside of this worldline.</p>
<p>「Someone's universe was there.」</p>
<p>A floating thread of truth whirled toward me</p>
<p>「Teeth-bite-teeth-bite-teeth-bite-teeth-bite」</p>
<p>I recognized that story immediately. It was the story of the fear I had tamed—the 'Tooth Fin'.</p>
<p>Why is this story here?</p>
<p>As I tilted my head in puzzlement, I spotted a small tag beneath the story.</p>
<p>「500,000 coins.」</p>
<p>500,000 coins?</p>
<p>Looking closer, I saw price tags attached to each story floating nearby.</p>
<p>「880,000 coins.」</p>
<p>「1,000,000 coins.」</p>
<p>「4,800,000 coins.」</p>
<p>Many stories were unfamiliar to me, but one installation stood out.</p>
<p>「"■■ah. We can ■■ the world."」</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the story's price tag.</p>
<p>「Valuing...」</p>
<p>Had this story not been priced yet?</p>
<p>As I bowed my head, I felt the threads forming my hands twitch.</p>
<p>「Every story in the world has a 'price' assigned to it.」</p>
<p>This seemed to be the law governing the 'space' within this scale.</p>
<p>In that instant, I suddenly wondered.</p>
<p>「Then how much value would 'I' be assigned here?」</p>
<p>As if reading my inner thoughts, I heard the sound of the scale's beam shifting in the darkness. Clang. The sound rang out. It rippled out like a bird's cry, deepening the folds across the entire universe.</p>
<p>And clang.</p>
<p>It sounded like a weight dropping onto a giant disc. Each time the sound echoed, the surrounding sacred flames flickered uneasily.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>The intervals between the sounds grew shorter and shorter.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud—</p>
<p>Soon, it swallowed every other sound in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The sound of something breaking. The moment when all of spacetime tilted and twisted.</p>
<p>[Enough.]</p>
<p>A mantra echoed through the darkness. It was a voice so unpleasant and cold it felt like it was tearing through the inner walls of my heart.</p>
<p>I heard someone ticking off a scale, like an alarm clock.</p>
<p>[Those who collect discarded dreams all have peculiar thoughts.]</p>
<p>In the silence that enveloped the area, the owner of the scale gazed at me with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>[So, did you bring something more valuable than 'hair' this time?]</p>
<p>The moment I saw his face, several faces came to mind at once.</p>
<p>He looked like Ji Eunyu, or Dansu ahjussi. Or like Killer King, or like Yerin-ssi. Upon closer inspection, he resembled Kyung Sein.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>He also resembled me.</p>
<p>Or perhaps he wasn't any of them. For a moment, I realized something.</p>
<p>「The owners of those faces have all brought 'fear' to the 'Settlement Scale' and appraised it.」</p>
<p>The people I confirmed were all readers whose names had been on the 'Appraisal Rankings'.</p>
<p>[Hmm, if it's difficult to appraise with the 'Settlement Scale', then that's a bit problematic...]</p>
<p>The faces that had seemed like different people in real time had become fixed.</p>
<p>It was Kim Dokja's face.</p>
<p>However, even though they had the same Kim Dokja face, I could now tell them all apart.</p>
<p>Looking at Kim Dokja's face, smiling brightly before my eyes, I recalled the record at the top of the 'All-Time Appraisal Rankings'.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>1st Place, Unidentified Fingernail Fragment, 10,000 D Coins, ■■■.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>As expected, the owner of that ranking seemed to be 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'. The 'Hunchback King' before me had already met and traded with 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>[Since there's no answer, perhaps you've come to sell yourself? If so, you'll need to prepare a larger scale. The scales here aren't suited to your weight—]</p>
<p>"I have no intention of selling myself."</p>
<p>I quickly added.</p>
<p>"I've come to make a deal with you."</p>
<p>At the word 'deal', the Hunchback King smiled inexplicably.</p>
<p>[Yes, what have you come to trade, fragment of the 'Oldest Dream'?]</p>
<p>I wasn't particularly surprised or flustered. There was no way a being of the caliber of the 'Hunchback King' wouldn't know who I was.</p>
<p>The 'Eyes of the Great Demon' glowed crimson.</p>
<p>In his eyes, the past and future of this worldline trembled.</p>
<p>"What I'm dealing with is this."</p>
<p>I looked into his eyes and said,</p>
<p>"Your future."</p>
<p>[My future?]</p>
<p>The Hunchback King tilted his head for a moment, then smiled with amusement.</p>
<p>[You know my 'future'?]</p>
<p>I recalled the final scenario of the main story.</p>
<p>In the final scenario, the Hunchback King reached beyond the 'final wall' with the Dokkaebi King.</p>
<p>I clearly remembered his end.</p>
<p>"You."</p>
<p>He was a superhuman, beyond the norm, but he wasn't the main character of the story. Because of this, I could only understand a fraction of his records. But even in those few, I could clearly sense the emotion.</p>
<p>「A very ancient loneliness.」</p>
<p>The loneliness of someone who has lived for an excruciatingly long time in this vast universe.</p>
<p>"Aren't you living your whole life to glimpse beyond the 'Final Wall'?"</p>
<p>Constellations that have explored all the world's stories and still crave stories. Anyone who has gazed into the universe composed of such constellations for a long time will inevitably ask the following question:</p>
<p>"Why do stories exist in this world?"</p>
<p>The Hunchback King answered in a voice that revealed no particular agitation.</p>
<p>[That's a huge question. There is no 'being' who can answer such a question.]</p>
<p>I nodded. I, too, don't know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>"But there are things I can tell you. For example."</p>
<p>I continued, examining the countless clusters of stories floating in the darkness—the price tags.</p>
<p>"What lies beyond the 'wall' you once knew, and what became of you who saw it?"</p>
<p>This was a gamble for me, too. If I revealed this truth to the Hunchback King, there was no guarantee that the very foundation of this universe wouldn't be distorted again.</p>
<p>"Aren't you curious?"</p>
<p>Still, I had no other means of bargaining. The Hunchback King was one of the most powerful beings in this worldline, and there were probably few stories he didn't know. This knowledge I possessed was the only one he might have missed, even if only a little.</p>
<p>The Hunchback King paused for a moment, as if trying to grasp my meaning. He then gazed at the tangled stories floating in the air and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>[Your brother also came to me.]</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>The brother he was talking about must have meant 'Snowfield Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>He was Kim Dokja, who had come closer than anyone else to the 'Oldest Dream'.</p>
<p>If he had visited here, he must have come to trade something.</p>
<p>"What did he trade?"</p>
<p>I thought he might not tell me, but the Hunchback King answered with an inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>[He asked me for one thing in exchange for his story. It was quite amusing to me. No one had ever asked me that before.]</p>
<p>"What was his request?"</p>
<p>[He asked me to make him a mere incarnation of the 'Scenario' in exchange for a portion of his story.]</p>
<p>Goosebumps slowly rose from the tips of my toes.</p>
<p>I had a vague idea of ​​what 'Snowfield Kim Dokja' had been pursuing during the past eight years while I was gone.</p>
<p>[So I asked. You've already become closer to the being you desire. So why do you want to go back to the beginning?]</p>
<p>The story, floating in the air, spoke for me, the reason why Kim Dokja, who had become closer to the 'real Kim Dokja', returned to his incarnation body and tackled the scenarios at the end of the world.</p>
<p>I knew it, he knew it, and perhaps every other Kim Dokja knew it too.</p>
<p>「"Because I think it'll be more fun."」</p>
<p>A piece of floating fingernail—perhaps that piece was proof of Snowfield Kim Dokja's deal with the Hunchback King.</p>
<p>I checked the price tag attached to the fingernail.</p>
<p>「Stop measuring value.」</p>
<p>The inability to measure value and the cessation of value measurement were completely different concepts.</p>
<p>In a voice as clear as the distinct difference between the two, the Hunchback King spoke to me.</p>
<p>[Unfortunately, I have no interest in my own future.]</p>
<p>"Is it because it's more fun not to know?"</p>
<p>The Hunchback King laughed without answering.</p>
<p>I reviewed the plan in my head. I had considered the possibility of the Hunchback King reacting in this way. The only question was this: Is there another 'story' about me that the Hunchback King might be curious about?</p>
<p>[But I am interested in the future you will see.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, I raised my head and flinched.</p>
<p>Since when had it been? The distance between me and the Hunckback King had become incredibly close.</p>
<p>His 'Eyes of the Great Demon' shone brightly before my very eyes.</p>
<p>[Future Vision, the vision of this world's future.]</p>
<p>I wondered. Anna Croft couldn't read my future. So, what about the Hunchback King? Will he see the end of this world I'm about to face?</p>
<p>[You, perhaps.]</p>
<p>For the first time, a faint tremble filled the voice of the Hunchback King, who gazed at me with swirling eyes.</p>
<p>[Have you ever heard of a 'very large baby'?]</p>
