<hr/>
<p>Han Sooyoung collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>The man’s hands were drained of all color, and the sentences, crumbling like dust from his fingertips, whispered in her ears.</p>
<p>「He was once Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>It couldn't be.</p>
<p>Yet no matter how many times she shook her head in denial, the reality before her eyes did not change.</p>
<p>「The 49% of Kim Dokja she had cut down with her own hands.」</p>
<p>When the fragments of Kim Dokja scattered across the universe, she had considered the possibility that such an existence might exist.</p>
<p>That the Kim Dokja she had thought was an [Avatar] might also have been reborn somewhere far beyond the distant reaches of the cosmos, reduced to a tiny fragment.</p>
<p>「"Oh my, our son is so impressive."」</p>
<p>In that universe, he would live a new life under a new name.</p>
<p>「"Honey, I guess he likes books. He will become a scholar, right?"」</p>
<p>Unlike Kim Dokja, he would have grown up in a warm family, cherished by his parents.</p>
<p>「"Waaaaah-"」</p>
<p>Maybe he cried after losing his first love.</p>
<p>「"Kuu. Kut. Kut. Love... only makes people weak."」</p>
<p>He would have indulged in youthful recklessness, creating embarrassing memories.</p>
<p>「Hakhyun, what's your dream?」</p>
<p>Maybe he even found that new dream he had longed for so deeply.</p>
<p>「"A writer."」</p>
<p>And worked towards that dream.</p>
<p>[Announcement of the Winner of the 24th Rookie of the Year Award. Winning Work: The Origin of Memory. Author: Lee Hakhyun]</p>
<p>At times, he would have hit the limits of reality and fallen into despair.</p>
<p>「"I'm sorry, author. As you know, the print book market isn't doing well these days..."」</p>
<p>「"How about writing a web novel? These days, that's..."」</p>
<p>But he never abandoned that dream.</p>
<p>「"Writer. You can't write like this. Did you even read the dialogue you wrote out loud?"」</p>
<p>「"Um... do you think I can really make a living by writing?"」</p>
<p>As a reward for not giving up on his dream, he faced the man from his dreams.</p>
<p>「"You look like a web novel writer."」</p>
<p>Finally, he reached the origins of his lost self.</p>
<p>「"Editor. I might have an idea."」</p>
<p>「"What is the title of this new work?"」</p>
<p>「"It’s 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』."」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung read and re-read his stories that were infrequently cut off.</p>
<p>He is the one who refused to be reborn as Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>The one who helped his comrades recover his lost memories.</p>
<p>That man, once a ‘reader’ who had forgotten this story,</p>
<p>「"I also want to have my own story."」</p>
<p>had returned to the story as a 'writer'.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung held his hand for a long time.</p>
<p>"Wake up."</p>
<p>His limp body swayed helplessly.</p>
<p>"You didn't come here to die."</p>
<p>It was not a wound that could be healed.</p>
<p>"After everything you went through, you left to live the life you wanted."</p>
<p>Why did he have to come back here again?</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung did not know the answer. Perhaps Lee Hakhyun himself would have to find it.</p>
<p>Instead, Han Sooyoung recalled all the sentences she knew of 'Ways of Survival' and 'Omniscient Reader'.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much she thought about it, there was no way to heal his wounds in this world now.</p>
<p>After taking a light breath, Han Sooyoung lifted her head. Like someone searching for stars in the night sky, she stared into the darkness for a long moment, then slipped her hand into her coat.</p>
<p>Tsutsutsutsutsutsutsu.</p>
<p>[The &lt;Star Stream&gt; is watching you.]</p>
<p>[Some nebulae are watching your actions.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are wary of your actions!]</p>
<p>[The Administration Bureau is determining the「Probability Conformity」of your actions!]</p>
<p>The channel fluctuated violently, and the approach of a probability aftermath could be felt.</p>
<p>In the &lt;Star Stream&gt;, saving someone requires far more probability than killing someone. Moreover, if death is already certain, there's no need to say more.</p>
<p>Moments later, a small pill was held in Han Sooyoung's hand.</p>
<p>The Life and Death Pill.</p>
<p>It is the ultimate medicine created by Lee Seolhwa, and an item that does not yet exist in this world.</p>
<p>She hadn’t expected to use the emergency medicine she brought along just in case here.</p>
<p>[Many constellations doubt the existence of the item you took out.]</p>
<p>[The Bureau prepares for scenario intervention!]</p>
<p>If she used this item, a probability aftermath would inevitably strike her.</p>
<p>Because it was an item that should not exist in this world.</p>
<p>"This wasn’t the [Avatar] meant to be sacrificed here, but..."</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung pushed the Life and Death Pill into Lee Hakhyun's mouth. Along with the cozy warmth, soon his whole body was dyed with a soft light.</p>
<p>There was something she wanted to ask.</p>
<p>But now she had no time. With white sparks, her avatar faded little by little. The aftermath of probability began to roll in.</p>
<p>At the last moment, she squeezed the lemon candy in Lee Hakhyun's hand and said.</p>
<p>"Tell him that I received it well."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Soft snowflakes brushed against my cheeks.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes to a pure white sky, I immediately realized where I was.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja!」</p>
<p>As I jumped up and shouted, a familiar voice answered from behind me.</p>
<p>「I’m here.」</p>
<p>In the middle of the snowy field, Kim Dokja was crouched down, reading something.</p>
<p>Ways of Survival? Or has someone written a new novel in the meantime?</p>
<p>The moment that thought crossed my mind, I felt like I wanted to die.</p>
<p>「The lemon candy.」</p>
<p>"Sorry, I couldn’t keep my promise."</p>
<p>Kim Dokja laughed wordlessly.</p>
<p>I looked around with a feeling of embarrassment.</p>
<p>But I couldn't help it. My pride as a writer was also hurt.</p>
<p>「How was Han Sooyoung?」</p>
<p>I thought for a while and replied.</p>
<p>「She was strong.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja fought against such a Han Sooyoung several times. After fighting again and again, they eventually became friends.</p>
<p>「And, she was an excellent writer.」</p>
<p>Feeling a bit relieved, I added a word.</p>
<p>「Honestly, it felt like that worldline would be fine even without me.」</p>
<p>The theater dungeon had been cleared, and my role was finished.</p>
<p>That 'Han Sooyoung' wouldn't insist on the same ending after witnessing my death.</p>
<p>If it's her, she would find a way somehow.</p>
<p>An ending that won't seal Yoo Joonghyuk or sacrifice the readers.</p>
<p>A method I couldn’t find, she would find.</p>
<p>「Han Sooyoung doesn’t seem to think so.」</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I wondered what that meant. Was it the fatigue? My head wasn't working properly.</p>
<p>「Because this is your story.」</p>
<p>My story.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt dizzy.</p>
<p>「I’m just an extra villain. All I've done this whole time is incite myself to be someone other than myself.」</p>
<p>Throughout the scenarios, I became Kim Dokja again and again, and Yoo Joonghyuk as well. I forced my way through the scenarios like that, and in the end, I died.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it's because I wasn't the real Kim Dokja or Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>「You are Lee Hakhyun.」</p>
<p>I don't know why, but the moment I heard those words, I felt like crying.</p>
<p>「As well as Cheon Inho.」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「The name isn't important. What matters is that you were telling your story there.」</p>
<p>It felt like I’d heard something similar before.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t remember who had said it to me.</p>
<p>My consciousness slowly began to fade.</p>
<p>Maybe because I was about to die.</p>
<p>Struggling against sleepiness, I asked Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「You...」</p>
<p>I wanted to ask him something, but I didn't know what. There were too many I wanted to ask.</p>
<p>Weren't you tired?</p>
<p>Enduring that long scenario, that story, all those years... didn’t you ever want to give up?</p>
<p>Why didn't you go back to your party members yet?</p>
<p>Kim Dokja opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「There’s a spell I recite when I’m struggling.」</p>
<p>I knew what the spell was.</p>
<p>We spoke at the same time.</p>
<p>「I am Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>The name is not important.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt like I could understand what he was saying.</p>
<p>In the first place, hadn't we endured life by borrowing each other's stories over and over again?</p>
<p>「I tried that too, but it didn’t really make me become Yoo Joonghyuk.」</p>
<p>「That's right.」</p>
<p>I couldn't forget the look on Kim Dokja's face as he said those words and nodded.</p>
<p>「But after saying that, I felt a little more like Kim Dokja.」</p>
<hr/>
<p>With a dizzying pain radiating through my entire body, I snapped my eyes open.</p>
<p>It felt like I should use that phrase I’d just heard.</p>
<p>“I am Yoo Joonghyuk.”</p>
<p>No incite was used. Even so, I felt a little energized.</p>
<p>Breathing out and raising my upper body, I saw the roof of the theater dungeon in ruins.</p>
<p>I felt a faint magical power swirling near my heart. New flesh had sprouted on my chest, where a hole had clearly been pierced, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>
<p>「I'm alive.」</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out how this could be possible.</p>
<p>Obviously, I fought with Han Sooyoung and died from being pierced through the chest.</p>
<p>The last sentence I wrote ended with my death. The scene was titled 'Death of the Villain,' making that outcome irreplaceable.</p>
<p>「Still, I was alive.」</p>
<p>Something slid down my shoulder with a gurgling sound.</p>
<p>The white coat Han Sooyoung had been wearing.</p>
<p>Holding onto the coat, I stood up and looked around.</p>
<p>I saw Yoo Joonghyuk and Jung Heewon lying unconscious. Their breathing was steady, so it didn’t seem like their injuries were serious.</p>
<p>Where did Han Sooyoung go?</p>
<p>The dawn was slowly breaking.</p>
<p>A meteor shower streaked across the sky's horizon.</p>
<p>It belatedly reminded me that this was the theater dungeon.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja and his companions must have seen that scene too.</p>
<p>The words of Kim Dokja, who had been watching the meteor shower with infinitely cold eyes, were finally felt through my skin.</p>
<p>「The scenario has just begun.」</p>
<p>I had already lost my life on only the third main scenario.</p>
<p>The chilling sensation of death was still vivid in front of me.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to survive this time, but will I be able to do that again next time?</p>
<p>The scenarios to come were so terrifying that they could not even be compared to the theater dungeon.</p>
<p>Will the readers who came with me be able to endure all the trials and survive?</p>
<p>「Because this is your story.」</p>
<p>Can I protect them?</p>
<p>I pressed my hand to my forehead, trying to fend off the dizziness.</p>
<p>I could hear people's footsteps in the distance. After the scenario ended, the people who escaped from the movie were climbing up to the rooftop one by one.</p>
<p>Finally, the door on the roof burst open, and someone took the first step and asked me.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>I glanced around absentmindedly, but Kim Dokja was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Understanding came a little too late.</p>
<p>Behind me, the strong backlight of dawn cast deep shadows across my face. My hand pressed against my face as a wave of dizziness washed over me, and I realized the exterior reinforced suit worn by the original Kim Dokja was still with me.</p>
<p>And the white coat clutched in my hand made everything clear. I knew what they had seen and how they had misunderstood.</p>
<p>I laughed and wanted to say I wasn’t Kim Dokja, but seeing the faces of people on the verge of collapse, every word inside me lost its strength and vanished.</p>
<p>People who read stories and loved stories.</p>
<p>They watched the stories of their favorite characters and endured life with joy or sorrow.</p>
<p>I heard people behind me asking the people who came through the door first.</p>
<p>"Hey, Kim Dokja?"</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja? Really?"</p>
<p>Desperate words from deep despair.</p>
<p>Beyond the door they opened, they hoped that there would be the Kim Dokja they were looking for.</p>
<p>「That moment. I understood Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>The sound of a small meteorite falling in the distance was heard.</p>
<p>I quietly looked down at the coat Han Sooyoung had left behind.</p>
<p>「I am writer Lee Hakhyun and instigator Cheon Inho.」</p>
<p>Perhaps this is something only I can do.</p>
<p>['Thoughts of Almost Anything' transforms into 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit'.]</p>
<p>I quietly closed my eyes and recalled a man's face.</p>
<p>[The effect of 'Ever-changing Stealth Suit' is activated!]</p>
<p>A man who grinned at people with a blank face.</p>
<p>A person who wanted to see the epilogue of a novel while knowing the end of this world alone.</p>
<p>The protagonist of this story.</p>
<p>A white coat fluttered in the wind that blew over the building.</p>
<p>When I completely removed my hands from my face, the people who saw my face burst into tears.</p>
<p>"So he really, really existed."</p>
<p>"I told you! I knew he would be here!"</p>
<p>Just by confirming someone's existence, hope was blooming on people's faces.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja!"</p>
<p>At one time, when I heard that name, one side of my chest hurt.</p>
<p>But now it wasn't like that.</p>
<p>「Still, this world needs Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>I don't know if there really is Kim Dokja in this world or not.</p>
<p>「Nevertheless, this is still a story about Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>Fortunately, lying is what I do best.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and waved at people.</p>
<p>「However, it is not a story about only one Kim Dokja.」</p>
