<hr/>
<p>The moment I heard that question, I remembered what had happened with Han Sooyoung in the 1,863rd round.</p>
<p>「"There's definitely a 'huge baby' somewhere in this universe."」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung said. She believed there was a 'huge baby' in this universe, and that baby, she believed, was the source of all these stories.</p>
<p>I stared straight into the Wenny King's eyes and asked,</p>
<p>"You're curious about the origin of this universe, aren't you?"</p>
<p>For the first time, a hint of emotion flashed across the Wenny King's face. A flicker of excitement flickered deep within his eyes.</p>
<p>[As expected, you knew.]</p>
<p>Despite living for so long, the King still loved stories.</p>
<p>[Did you hear it from her?]</p>
<p>Perhaps the Wenny King had already guessed I'd heard this information from Han Sooyoung.</p>
<p>I paused for a moment, then nodded and continued.</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>[That's right. At this point, she's probably the only one who's reached the truth of the universe.]</p>
<p>"You have that same expression on your face, don't you?"</p>
<p>[What do I look like?]</p>
<p>Like a child desperate to solve a question right now.</p>
<p>"You look envious."</p>
<p>The Wenny King smiled.</p>
<p>[Me? Do I really look like that?]</p>
<p>Looking at him again, he seemed less like a child desperate to solve a question and more like an old man who'd never wanted to know the answer.</p>
<p>Looking at that expression, I thought about the 'story' that would determine the end of this world—the ultimate dream of all Constellations.</p>
<p>「A Single Story.」</p>
<p>Completing a Single Story, dedicating it to the [Final Wall], and creating an immortal record.</p>
<p>The Wenny King before me, and the other Mythical Constellations, are probably living towards that conclusion.</p>
<p>But as that conclusion draws near, they will feel a complex ambivalence.</p>
<p>「The desire to know the end of a story, and the wish that it would continue forever.」</p>
<p>The fact that even the Oldest Beings in this world couldn't escape such instincts struck me as quite tragicomic.</p>
<p>[Did she say anything else?]</p>
<p>"I think I should ask that."</p>
<p>I shook my head and quickly added,</p>
<p>"What exactly is this 'huge baby' you speak of?"</p>
<p>The universe of the 'TWSA' I'm talking about began in the mind of a boy. Han Sooyoung wrote that, and I believe it too.</p>
<p>But Han Sooyoung, in the 1,863rd round, didn't think so.</p>
<p>「"Do you really think a mere boy's imagination could shape the universe?"」</p>
<p>Even if Kim Dokja, as a child, provided that 'imagination', the being who 'realized' it wasn't Kim Dokja. That was why Han Sooyoung proposed the concept of a 'huge baby'.</p>
<p>[You're foolish. You could have used that as an excuse to make a deal with me.]</p>
<p>"Don't you already know that I don't know?"</p>
<p>The Wenny King nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer, and asked back.</p>
<p>[Aren't you afraid of knowing the truth of the world?]</p>
<p>The Wenny King looked up at the sky. Perhaps not, but in this &lt;Star Stream&gt;, there are few Constellations higher in the sky than that one.</p>
<p>I didn't know what world the Wenny King was gazing at, or what he felt as he took his last breath in the main story.</p>
<p>All I could see was the price tags of the stories piled high like snow on his history.</p>
<p>[That everything we knew was just a part of the Great Being's dream—a ridiculous stage he devised. Isn't it truly terrifying to realize that we possess no innate value or meaning?]</p>
<p>Listening to those words, I felt as if I could vaguely understand why he put a price tag on stories. I thought for a moment and then answered.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid. I always think about it."</p>
<p>I recalled the world I'd lived in for a long time. Memories gradually fading as I entered the &lt;Star Stream&gt;. In that world, where scenarios, Dokkaebis, and Constellations were all fictional stories, people were still part of a stage someone had created.</p>
<p>On stage, people played the roles of good, bad, or the audience. From their respective positions, they argued, made mistakes, killed, or pointed fingers at someone.</p>
<p>They called the events on stage an inevitable reality, blamed the actors involved in the tragedy, and at the same time, indulged in it. They fueled their lives with it.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, I began to understand why Kim Dokja was so able to adapt to the world of 'Ways of Survival'.</p>
<p>Perhaps Kim Dokja survived in this world not simply because he was a reader of 'Ways of Survival' or because he was a master of the 'Fourth Wall'.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', nods at your thought.]</p>
<p>He was able to adapt so well to this world because he had already lived in the 'ruined world' before coming here.</p>
<p>The Wenny King tilted his head in confusion, perhaps sensing some sentiment in my response.</p>
<p>[Your brother said something similar.]</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p>
<p>[He said there was nothing to fear, since it was an ending he had seen countless times.]</p>
<p>An ending he had seen countless times.</p>
<p>I couldn't fully fathom the feelings of Snowfield Kim Dokja, who had relayed those words.</p>
<p>[Even I don't know much about the huge baby.]</p>
<p>After a short pause, the Wenny King began to speak.</p>
<p>[I only guess that its existence exists beyond the distant wall, in the 'deep sea of ​​■■■', where the first records were created.]</p>
<p>The deep sea of ​​■■■.</p>
<p>It was a story I had once heard from the 'Recorders of Fear'.</p>
<p>"Why are you so readily sharing that information with me?"</p>
<p>He, who placed a price on every story, couldn't help but value the information I shared. So, the reason the 'Wenny King' was sharing it with me now was clear.</p>
<p>He believed I would reach that place someday.</p>
<p>With a dark smile on his face, the Wenny King nodded and said,</p>
<p>[If you ever visit that place, show me the scenery. That's the condition of my deal with you.]</p>
<p>"Do you know why I came to negotiate?"</p>
<p>[Didn't you come here to ask for a transfer to a higher scenario?]</p>
<p>As expected, engaging in a power struggle with a being of the Wenny King's caliber wasn't easy.</p>
<p>[The Constellations might complain, but I can send you and one of your companions to the higher levels with my own strength.]</p>
<p>He even knew exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly at the Wenny King and asked,</p>
<p>"Thank you. But did you ask my brother the same thing?"</p>
<p>The Wenny King gave a sly smile instead of answering. He probably meant he couldn't tell me that much.</p>
<p>[Are you willing to make a deal?]</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>[Then let's get started right away. The timing isn't bad.]</p>
<p>The timing isn't bad?</p>
<p>[The Constellations and the Bureau were just distracted.]</p>
<p>I pictured the empty skies of the 'New Murim District'. Apparently, the sudden disappearance of the Constellations and the Bureau wasn't a coincidence.</p>
<p>"Is something happening in the higher-level scenario?"</p>
<p>[You have a knack for thievery. If you want to know that, you should leave something more significant than a hair.]</p>
<p>"Should I at least clip my fingernails?"</p>
<p>[If possible, how about pulling them out whole?]</p>
<p>We glared at each other, eyes narrowed, then simultaneously relaxed our expressions. Both he and I knew this deal couldn't go through.</p>
<p>[Just kidding.]</p>
<p>"I was joking, too."</p>
<p>I already felt uneasy about giving him hair, and I had no intention of giving him fingernails.</p>
<p>Licking his lips, the Wenny King waved his finger in the air, and a portal began to swirl and form. As I approached the portal, the Wenny King spoke, as if he'd forgotten.</p>
<p>[Oh, I almost forgot. I have a gift for you.]</p>
<p>"I'd rather not. Gifts like that usually end badly."</p>
<p>[Your brother gave it to me.]</p>
<p>I turned around and saw the Wenny King smiling at me, as if he'd expected me to. A small piece was spinning like a top at his fingertips. Just a glimpse from afar was enough for me to realize what it was.</p>
<p>「A fragment of a fingernail left behind by 'Snowfield Kim Dokja of the Snowfield'.」</p>
<p>The sublime quality of the story felt in the fingernail.</p>
<p>The Wenny King spoke with a hint of regret.</p>
<p>[I recently received this from the recorder recording his stories. He told me to tell him when you come here.]</p>
<p>My brother, too, seemed to have anticipated my search for the 'Wenny King' to advance to a higher scenario.</p>
<p>It wasn't strange.</p>
<p>Just as I was Kim Dokja, so was he. It was only natural that he was thinking what I was thinking.</p>
<p>"If it's a gift from my brother, I should accept it."</p>
<p>The moment I slowly reached out for the nail fragment he handed me, a fragment stirred within my heart.</p>
<p>[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', growls.]</p>
<p>Heir was wary of that fragment. The closer it got, the clearer the fragments contained within became.</p>
<p>A faint fear rose within me. Snowfield Kim Dokja had left such a story fragment here, even before the final battle of the worldline. His confidence was astonishing, and at the same time, I was curious about the fragments he had left behind, even at the risk of such a loss. The moment I finally read the first sentence of the story, which was right before my eyes,</p>
<p>「That day, in the 41st round, Kim Dokja returned.」</p>
<p>I realized what this story was about.</p>
<p>「"Who… are you?"」</p>
<p>「"Who do you wish me to be?"」</p>
<p>The story was about a protagonist.</p>
<p>「"I am Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>And it was about the people who knew that protagonist well.</p>
<p>「"From now on, I will lead the scenario."」</p>
<p>I gazed at the rippling story with trembling eyes.</p>
<p>「Before me lay the myth of the past eight years, personally built by Snowfield Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>Even without reading, emotions seeped through the margins of the sentences. They were the emotions of the people who had created this story together.</p>
<p>Listening to the voice of the Wenny King, I discerned glimpses of those emotions.</p>
<p>[If you don't want it, it's okay not to accept it. However.]</p>
<p>In the midst of the flowing emotions, countless people called out a single name.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>People called out his name, rejoicing or mourning.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja?"」</p>
<p>They mourned or marveled.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja!"」</p>
<p>They sometimes admired him.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja..."」</p>
<p>Or they were relieved.</p>
<p>「There, unknown to me, were the eight years of Kim Dokja and his companions.」</p>
<p>The fingertips reaching for the story flinched. It was a first time I hesitated to read anything. Because,</p>
<p>「It seemed like there was nothing for me to write in this story.」</p>
<p>The Wenny King added, as if he found my reaction amusing.</p>
<p>[Your brother said you must have many questions, and that if you open the story, you will find the answers.]</p>
<p>My face was reflected in the Wenny King’s red retina. An expression so clear and undeniable, it was impossible to deny.</p>
<p>And so, for the first time, I learned about myself.</p>
<p>[There are stories whose endings are so intriguing yet so terrifying to see.]</p>
<p>I have that expression on my face as I turn the last page of a book.</p>
<p>[So that’s how the story is to you, Kim Dokja.]</p>
