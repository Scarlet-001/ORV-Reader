<hr/>
<p>Han Sooyoung could not understand the situation unfolding before her eyes.</p>
<p>"What the hell?"</p>
<p>She looked down at Cheon Inho, collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>Blood poured relentlessly from his chest, where 'Unbreakable Faith' had pierced straight through.</p>
<p>It was an irreversible wound.</p>
<p>There was already too much blood pooling across the floor. Whether it was the 'Ellain Forest Essence' or anything else, nothing she could do now would bring him back.</p>
<p>"You, why the hell?"</p>
<p>The writer of ORV from another wordline, wearing Cheon Inho's face.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung understood his cause and his desperate desire to save his readers.</p>
<p>"I... I said I would do something, didn't I?"</p>
<p>This world was the &lt;Star Stream&gt;.</p>
<p>Once a scenario began, someone's sacrifice was inevitable.</p>
<p>The outcome of 'Destruction' was predetermined, so Han Sooyoung decided to end it as quickly as possible with minimal sacrifice.</p>
<p>She knew it would be harsh on the characters.</p>
<p>However, leaving things as they were would lead to an even greater tragedy in this round and trying to change the ending could cause a catastrophe across all worldlines</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung took on the role of a villain once again.</p>
<p>She designed an ending with minimal pain.</p>
<p>Her plan was to retrieve the souls of the possessed individuals caught up in the scenarios and return them to their original worldline with minimal loss.</p>
<p>Everything went smoothly until that guy appeared.</p>
<p>「If you are a writer, you would know.」</p>
<p>The words he’d left behind echoed endlessly through her mind.</p>
<p>「You're not trying to finish the story, you're giving up.」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung gasped for breath as she felt the probability.</p>
<p>Why did he say that? Why did he jump in front of her?</p>
<p>「You were supposed to try to convince me, right?」</p>
<p>She never intended to kill him. If that had been her plan, she would have severed his neck right away.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as if following the predetermined path of a tragedy, her 'Unbreakable Faith' pierced right through his chest.</p>
<p>「Are you ready to be convinced?」</p>
<p>She tried to alter the sword’s trajectory mid-strike, again and again, but her muscles wouldn't obey, as if the world itself were demanding his death.</p>
<p>'No way.'</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung recalled the achromatic landscape that had unfolded moments before.</p>
<p>What if that was this guy's 'skill'?</p>
<p>What if he had a skill that created the events he desired, but at the cost of probability? What if, as the price of that probability, he sacrificed himself?</p>
<p>「Han Sooyoung knew someone who had sacrificed himself in this way.」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung staggered in the rising dizziness, slowly bending down toward the fallen Cheon Inho.</p>
<p>She wanted to ask him a question before he died. Why the hell did he do this?</p>
<p>Then Cheon Inho's hand slipped out of his pocket with a thud. In his hand was a lollipop of a somewhat familiar shape.</p>
<p>As if she had stumbled upon an inexplicable sentence written in the most unexpected place, Han Sooyoung stared blankly down at the candy.</p>
<p>Slowly, she reached out her hand.</p>
<p>Sparks flew with the sound of 'Tsutsutsu'. Stories spilled from the lollipop in his hand, like something long sealed finally breaking open.</p>
<p>A story?</p>
<p>It couldn't be. The third main scenario was only just about to end.</p>
<p>Unless he's a special case like her, there's no way an incarnation could have already acquired a 'story'—</p>
<p>「"What are you doing? Hurry up and get ready! Did you forget where we’re going today?"」</p>
<p>Something incomprehensible happened.</p>
<p>Those were definitely her words, her voice.</p>
<p>But why does this guy have a story related to her?</p>
<p>「"Is this pizza?"」</p>
<p>「"It's chicken, idiot."」</p>
<p>「Today was the first day of &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;'s outing.」</p>
<p>The voices flowing out were familiar. All of them were voices she knew. These were sentences she knew.</p>
<p>「"It's so cold, do we really have to eat by the Han River?"」</p>
<p>Her mind grew increasingly confused.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「"You don't read it that much these days."」</p>
<p>A memory vividly surfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>She had definitely had that conversation with Kim Dokja before.</p>
<p>「"Oh, yes. I have to read it."」</p>
<p>An outing to the Han River sometime ago.</p>
<p>Huddled together with her party, she had a conversation with Kim Dokja about TWSA. She asked Kim Dokja something about Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>「"But Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>「"Huh?」</p>
<p>「"That kind of thing doesn't come up in the 3rd round of Ways of Survival."」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja couldn't answer.</p>
<p>「"Hey. Who the hell are you?"」</p>
<p>Slowly, a chill ran through her heart, and she struggled to breathe. From the first moment she saw him, she’d thought something was off.</p>
<p>Who the hell is this Cheon Inho?</p>
<p>She knew that he was an author of ORV from another world line, but there were too many strange things to ignore about him to simply dismiss it like that.</p>
<p>「"If you have 'Avatar', isn’t there a very easy way to check it?"」</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung reached for the lemon candy with trembling fingertips.</p>
<p>「"The person who will read my novel... is not you."」</p>
<p>Stories flowed like blood from a burst wound.</p>
<p>It's a story that even Han Sooyoung, who wrote 'Ways of Survival', doesn't know.</p>
<p>「He walked toward his origin like that.」</p>
<p>It was a story no one had ever read, existing between the lines of the sentences she had written.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Few people remember the moment they were first born.</p>
<p>For me, it was the same.</p>
<p>「Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>People called me that, and I introduced myself that way too.</p>
<p>Alone and son.</p>
<p>Bearing the name my father had given me, I lived a life of living up to it.</p>
<p>I have always done everything alone, eating alone, working alone, sleeping alone.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why...</p>
<p>When I was no longer 'alone' for the first time, I heard strange words.</p>
<p>「"Hey. Who are you?"」</p>
<p>A colleague I had always trusted, the person I thought maybe who could understand me best in the world.</p>
<p>It wasn’t true.</p>
<p>She easily overpowered me and threw me onto the cold floor.</p>
<p>Then she told the others that I was an ‘avatar’.</p>
<p>I didn't understand.</p>
<p>Surely, just moments ago, we ate together, laughed, and chatted. Why are you suddenly saying such things to me?</p>
<p>The reason was simple.</p>
<p>I couldn't properly remember a certain novel.</p>
<p>Thinking it was a trivial misunderstanding, I smiled as usual and said,</p>
<p>「"Han Sooyoung. I'm sorry, but I don't really remember it well. I haven't been reading 'Ways of Survival' lately."」</p>
<p>The woman's dagger flew through the air, and blood burst from my shoulder blades.</p>
<p>The companions criticized her.</p>
<p>They defended me, saying I wasn't fake. Avatars don't bleed.</p>
<p>Still, she did not back down.</p>
<p>「"If I cut your throat, I'll know. Avatars keep moving even after their throats are cut off"」</p>
<p>The moment my eyes met hers, I felt a chill run down my spine.</p>
<p>And I thought.</p>
<p>「Maybe, I'm really not Kim Dokja after all.」</p>
<p>My memory of that day isn't clear.</p>
<p>Only that the wound hurt quite a bit.</p>
<p>That even though it was a shallow wound, the blood wouldn't stop flowing..</p>
<p>That I collapsed right there.</p>
<p>Only those facts remain vaguely in my mind.</p>
<p>「"Dokja-ssi, are you okay?"」</p>
<p>Even after that day, the group continued to call me 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>But every time I heard that name, I felt myself drifting further away from my own identity.</p>
<p>「"You probably just lost your memory because you were tired. Don’t worry too much."」</p>
<p>Even as I was being comforted, I felt confused.</p>
<p>「What on earth did I forget?」</p>
<p>I couldn't tell.</p>
<p>People who forget their memories don't remember what they've forgotten.</p>
<p>But from the moment I realized I 'forgot something', I felt strange.</p>
<p>My complexion grew worse by the day, and my vivid memories were fading away.</p>
<p>I became increasingly afraid.</p>
<p>「"Yoo Sangah-ssi, I am not a fake."」</p>
<p>「"Yes. I know."」</p>
<p>My companion held my hand with a warm smile, But for some reason, that smile felt unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>The companion's smile was not directed at me, but rather seemed to be accidentally placed on the empty seat where the 'real Kim Dokja' was.</p>
<p>The time I slept became longer, and I often listened to my companions in my hazy dreams.</p>
<p>「"Dokja-ssi, can you stand up for a second? If you keep lying down, your back will get ruined."」</p>
<p>「"How about doing some gymnastics with me?"」</p>
<p>「"Will he be okay like this? I’ll bring a story pack just in case.」</p>
<p>The party members did not interrogate or accuse me.</p>
<p>Rather, they were discussing a possibility.</p>
<p>「"Heewon-ssi, have you heard of Sooyoung’s plan?"」</p>
<p>「"If Dokja-ssi’s memories truly split apart... and if the real Dokja-ssi is still out there somewhere..."」</p>
<p>「"Do you think that is possible?"」</p>
<p>The companion who first suspected me also visited my hospital room. Most of her visits were late at night.</p>
<p>In my languid consciousness, I often felt a hand pulling up the blanket.</p>
<p>She stared at me for a long time in the dark, then quietly disappeared from my hospital room by the time dawn came.</p>
<p>「"It’s rice, Kim Dokja."」</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I woke up, there was someone who brought me food.</p>
<p>I thought as I hurriedly finished my meal in extreme hunger.</p>
<p>I must have eaten this kind of dish a few times while going through the scenarios.</p>
<p>Why do I have no memory?</p>
<p>「"Someone once said this."」</p>
<p>The man glared at me with his sullen face and said.</p>
<p>「"Every human being suffers from amnesia."」</p>
<p>After saying that, the man stared at the clock hanging in the hospital room for a long time.</p>
<p>I watched the clock with him. I watched the second hand move, then the minute hand follow.</p>
<p>「"You don't have to be anything. It only matters what you want to be."」</p>
<p>I don't know if the words affected me or not. However, when I woke up the next day, I said something strange to the group.</p>
<p>「"I also want to help find the 'real Kim Dokja'".」</p>
<p>「Dokja-ssi, don't say that. There is no such a thing as real or fake. You are-"」</p>
<p>Of course, I didn't come to believe that there was a 'real' one.</p>
<p>I just wanted to know.</p>
<p>If the 'real Kim Dok-ja' does not exist, the fact that I am real will naturally be proven.</p>
<p>This story that I'm only an [Avatar]... that the real Kim Dokja is still trapped in the subway of the final scenario, dreaming... all those ridiculous hopes will eventually vanish from the party members' thoughts.</p>
<p>「"Please let me join the plan."」</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt;'s journey to recover the lost 'Kim Dokja'.</p>
<p>And so, I crossed over with the party members into wordline of the 1,865th round.</p>
<p>I didn't do a great job, but I watched my companions throughout the scenario.</p>
<p>Seeing my companions carry out hellish scenarios from scratch, I often felt an incomprehensible feeling.</p>
<p>「"Wow, is that the method Dokja used?"」</p>
<p>My companions silently performed the scenario.</p>
<p>As the scenario progressed, they each found the 'Kim Dokja' they were looking for.</p>
<p>「"This recipe was told to me by that ahjussi."」</p>
<p>In every moment of theirs, there was a ‘Kim Dokja’ I couldn't remember.</p>
<p>「Did he always do all this alone?」</p>
<p>While watching their story, I naturally realized a certain fact.</p>
<p>「This wasn't my story.」</p>
<p>It wasn't up to me to decide whether I was real or fake.</p>
<p>「Dokja-ssi, are you okay? I'll be right behind you. Leave this to us."」</p>
<p>They were sympathetic.</p>
<p>「"We’ll be fine on our own this time."」</p>
<p>I was taken care of.</p>
<p>「"Now it's our turn to give it back."」</p>
<p>Even that, perhaps, was not what I deserved.</p>
<p>After so many years, the party finally faced the end of the world.</p>
<p>Something in me knew. And for the first time, I put that feeling into words.</p>
<p>「"The other me might not want this. The story... ended there..."」</p>
<p>It was my last struggle and plea.</p>
<p>Please don't open it.</p>
<p>Please don’t open that door, the last car of the subway.</p>
<p>Then the woman answered.</p>
<p>「"Let’s meet that other you and ask him."」</p>
<p>In that moment, I sensed my role in the story.</p>
<p>「"If this is the story you all want..."」</p>
<p>Finally, the last subway car door opened, and I finally faced the sight I feared.</p>
<p>「There was Kim Dokja, whom the party had been looking for.」</p>
<p>Kim Dokja who had become like a child.</p>
<p>Kim Dokja, losing his memory just like me. But the moment I saw Kim Dokja, I realized.</p>
<p>「That Kim Dokja is the real Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>「"Ah... Ah, I..."」</p>
<p>Like a satellite drawn by a star’s gravitational pull, my body moved towards Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>The memories I held shattered into pieces, and were sucked into the Kim Dokja in front of me.</p>
<p>As I felt my body vanish, I thought</p>
<p>Then who was I?</p>
<p>「Dokja-ssi!」</p>
<p>I was Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dokja!"」</p>
<p>But not the Kim Dokja this world wanted.</p>
<p>「"Kim Dok...!"」</p>
<p>In the final moment before my consciousness faded, I thought:</p>
<p>「If I could be born again.」</p>
<p>A delusion, or so everyone believed. An impossible wish that only the real Kim Dokja could dream of.</p>
<p>「At least, I hope it's not as Kim Dokja.」</p>
<p>I imagined a distant universe, utterly unreachable in this world, and an unnamed being born within it.</p>
<p>A creature that no one in &lt;Kim Dokja’s Company&gt; recognizes and has nothing to do with Kim Dokja.</p>
<p>「I also want to have my own story.」</p>
<p>There was a sound like something exploding, and in the next instant, his consciousness shattered into fragments and scattered across the universe.</p>
<p>However, the largest fragment of consciousness that formed my core did not completely dissipate in the end and became a meteor.</p>
<p>The meteor set out on a very long voyage. Crossing the edge of the world line again and again, it drifted into the unknown depths of the universe.</p>
<p>How much longer did I sail like that?</p>
<p>The meteor stopped its journey.</p>
<p>「There was a planet that looked just like I imagined.」</p>
<p>The meteor fell toward the planet, shattering into even smaller fragments of soul.</p>
<p>Then it entered the body of a newborn baby at the planet's edge.</p>
<p>「"Why isn’t our baby crying?"」</p>
<p>A voice came, muffled and distant. I squeezed out my last strength and burst into a weary cry.</p>
<p>Then someone hugged me tightly.</p>
<p>「"Oh, he cried!"」</p>
<p>I was quietly wrapped in a blanket and placed on the bed.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I lost all my memories.</p>
<p>Or was it because the long journey was exhausting? I immediately fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>And when I awoke again, people called me by a name I had never heard before.</p>
<p>「"Lee Hakhyun. Your name is Lee Hakhyun."」</p>
<p>Finally, my wish came true.</p>
